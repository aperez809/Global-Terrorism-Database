# Global Terrorism Database

## About
	Our goal was to make an application that would be useful for anyone wanting
    to discover information about terrorism. We aimed to create something that 
    could aid in uncovering patterns of terrorism; possibly being utilized to 
    improve public safety and terrorism prevention around the world. 

    Our application utilized a database of over 170,000 incidents of terrorism,
    and our conceptual model had 13 tables that reveal information about each incident. 
    The UI of our application displays a map to the user, where incidents of 
    terrorism are represented as data points mapped by latitude and longitude. 

    An advised precaution when dealing with the data is not to place emphasis 
    on the amount of terrorist attacks over a span of many years, because 
    population and tools for documenting terrorism have changed over time. 
    Because of this, we provide a graphical interface that can filter terrorism events by year.
